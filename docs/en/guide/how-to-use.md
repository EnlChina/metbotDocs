# Met Bot Quick Start!

## Step 1: Find and Start the Bot

Search for [AgentMetBot](https://t.me/AgentMetBot) in the Telegram search bar, and click on the first option.

After starting the bot, click `/help` to view the help message.

> 💡 There are many available commands, but let's bind our game ID first!

---

## Step 2: Set Your Telegram Username (Recommended)

Please first confirm whether you have set a **Telegram Username**.  
This is very helpful for others to submit `met` requests with you!

> 📌 Note: You can still meet up without setting it, but others will need to manually enter your full game ID, which is more troublesome.

---

## Step 3: Bind Your Game ID (AgentName)

Long-press the `/set_agentname` command in the bot's help message, it will automatically be copied to your input box.

```
/set_agentname
```

Then enter your game ID (AgentName) directly in the input box, for example:

```
/set_agentname YourAgentName
```

Send it to complete the binding.

## Step 4: Apply for Verification (/bind)

Enter the command:

```
/bind
```

The bot will list the currently available **Met Bot Administrators**, and you can choose an admin you are familiar with for verification.

> ✅ Make sure the admin knows you!

After clicking on the corresponding admin, please **remind them to approve your verification in person or in other groups**.  
Although the bot will push verification messages, admins may not check them in time.

## Step 5: Initiate a Met!

There are two ways to initiate a `met`:

1. **Using the other person's Telegram Username** (Recommended)  
   In a group, type:
   ```
   /met @TheirUsername
   ```
   > If you're in the same group, it can auto-complete, which is very convenient!

2. **Using the other person's game Agent Name**  
   You need to enter their full game ID:
   ```
   /met TheirGameID
   ```

> ⚠️ The `Met` action **must happen within a group**, but cross-group `met` is supported.

## Step 6: Reply to Someone Else's Met Request

When someone `met` you, the bot will send you a notification like this:

**Steps to follow**:

1. **Click on the `/met xxxxx` text in the notification message** (don't manually select and copy!)  
   → This will automatically copy the command to your clipboard.
2. Go to a **group that has the bot**, paste and send the command.

✅ Congratulations! You've completed a successful meet-up! +10 points!

## Tips

- Record your meet-up moments with others! Have a great meal together~  
- **Don't have virtual meet-ups** (i.e., submitting met without actually meeting in person)!
